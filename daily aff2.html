<p>I feel like I haven't been doing very much to show my appreciation for you lately, and that's kind of made me wonder if most of the value in being my boyfriend has disappeared, too. I guess we both fall prey to the 'earning people's love' tendency, heh. I mention this to say that deeply appreciate you have been patient and steadfast in trying to take care of me even so.</p>

<h4><i>Like a drug.</i></h4>
